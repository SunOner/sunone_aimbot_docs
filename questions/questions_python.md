- All commands are executed from the command line when you are in the program's directory.
	- After launching the command line, execute the command `cd path_to_bot_unpacking`, for example, `cd C:\Users\amongus\downloads\sunone_aimbot-main`
- How to run the program from cmd?
	- `python run.py` or `py run.py`
	- (This is useful if the window closes after startup)
- How to change settings?
	- Open the file config.ini using Notepad or another text editor, after changing options save the file.
- Does it only work with Arduino?
	- No, Arduino is needed to trick the anti-cheat into thinking you are using a physical mouse.
- How to install a new model that I downloaded from boosty or patreon?
	- Place it in the `models/` folder, go to config.ini and change ai_model_name = sunxds_0.5.6.pt or ai_model_name = sunxds_0.5.6.engine, if you exported the model to .engine. Also, don't forget to change the model size `ai_model_image_size`.
- How to export a model?
	- Go to the [AI Models docs](https://github.com/SunOner/sunone_aimbot_docs/blob/main/ai_models/ai_models.md).
- The sight shoots above the head, how to adjust?
	- Change the `body_y_offset` parameter. The lower the value, the lower the aim.
- Movement or Autoshot does not work in some games.
    - Some games have protection against programmed mouse inputs. Use [Arduino](https://github.com/SunOner/HID_Arduino).
- Errors are reported and fixed in [discord](https://discord.gg/sunone). Channel named `errors-and-tips`.
- I have a suggestion for improvement!
    - [Create a topic here](https://github.com/SunOner/sunone_aimbot/discussions) or send me pm in Discord.
- The aimbot takes a long time to aim / It's kind of jerky / WARNING NMS time limit exceeded
	- Do not overload the graphics card!
	- Do not set high game settings.
	- Lock the frame rate (for example, if you have a 144Hz monitor, lock FPS to 144 in the game).
	- Turn off instant replays.
	- Try changing the screen resolution in the system to a lower one.
	- And so on...
- Where to download new models?
	- They can be obtained by supporting the project on [Boosty](https://boosty.to/sunone) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/sunone).
- There are false positives, how to eliminate them?
	- Increase the value of `AI_conf` in the config.
- AttributeError: 'Bettercam' object has no attribute 'is_capturing'
	- Go to "Settings->System->Display->Graphics->Classic Application-Overview" and add the python executable file (It should be here by default "C:\Users\your_user_name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe"), specify "energy saving" in the parameters. This is due to the fact that on most laptops, the duplicator is powered by an integrated graphics processor.
- The guidance is still jerky, as if the program is not working at full capacity.
	- In some cases, if you exported the model to the engine but the game is still jerky aiming, it helps to enable instant replay.
